# Disaster Area Extraction Model Fine-tuning

This project is a portfolio piece demonstrating the fine-tuning of a model for disaster area extraction.

## Description

This project aims to fine-tune a pre-trained model to accurately identify and extract disaster-stricken areas from images or satellite data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

## Model

The model used in this project is a fine-tuned version of [mention the base model, e.g., U-Net, Mask R-CNN, etc.].

## Data

The data used for training and evaluation is located in the `data/` directory.
